<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


RISE will connect female entrepreneurs with each other, and provide tailored resources to users based on their profiles. This will increase the number of female entrepreneurs via retention by encouraging them to stay in the business, and it will increase their capacity by providing a support network for growth. Being part of this community will also help members maintain their personal well-being, which often gets ignored in the pursuit of business ‘success’.

RISE is styled after popular dating apps, so that reaching out can be a more casual affair, even offering the option of playdates, for the entrepreneur and their socially-inclined children. We include badges in our first iteration to show progress in categories such as:

Education
Access tailored podcasts and resources for female entrepreneurs, such as JP Morgan’s Women on the Move podcast.

Bridge
A bridge badge encourages users to make their first mentor/mentee connection. Sometimes you need a nudge to make the first move.

Playdate
A playdate badge addresses the reality of raising a family while working. Children have strong social needs and fulfilling desire for playdates can also expand the social/professional network of the parent.

Be Better Together
This badge encourages users to pair up and attend larger events. A friend can sometimes sell you better than you can yourself.

Funding In order to break into the tribe, quarterly meet and greets with banks, venture capital funds, and other financial institutions are broadcasted onto the site. These meet and greets could focus on chosen users to participate in a “Shark Tank” style session, so that entrepreneurs can hone in on their idea, network, and get a chance to access funding.

Launch Once a business is launched, they are highlighted and featured as “success stories”.

### Built With


The concept for our web app was strictly done in frontend. We used Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap to make our web pages and get them up to our local server. The mock-up for the web pages were done using Figma. Git workflow was used for version control.
